# Fuel Consumption Calculator

## Project Overview

The Fuel Consumption Calculator is a web application developed using ReactJS and Typescript. It allows users to calculate the average fuel consumption per ton transported for a fleet of trucks. The application uses the MaterialUI 5 library for styling the components and the Formik library for the application form. The app also features a bar chart that calculates average fuel consumption by truck model.

### Deploy

Project is deployed and can be tested at: [Vercel](https://fuel-consumption-calculator.vercel.app/)

## Installation

To install the fuel consumption calculator, follow the steps below:

    Clone the repository from GitHub.
    Install the required dependencies using npm install.
    Start the development server using npm run dev.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5173/. The home page displays a form where you can input vehicle information, such as the distance traveled, fuel used, and weight transported. Once you submit the form, the application calculates the average fuel consumption per ton transported and displays the result on the screen.

## Features

The fuel consumption calculator application has the following features:

    A user-friendly form for entering vehicle information.
    Real-time calculations of the average fuel consumption per ton transported.
    Displays the average fuel consumption by truck model in a bar chart.
    Stores previously calculations in a table.
    Updates automatically every time a new calculation is made.
    Uses the react-chartjs-2 library to create the chart.
    Validation of form input using Formik.
    MaterialUI 5 styling that adheres to the Intelbras Brandbook guidelines.

## Technologies Used

The fuel consumption calculator is developed using the following technologies:

    ReactJS
    Typescript
    MaterialUI 5
    Formik
    Styled-components

## Notes

During the development of the Fuel Consumption Calculator, I encountered a few challenges that required me to adapt and learn on the go. The two main challenges I faced were:

### Learning MUI on the Go

Although I had some experience with MaterialUI before starting this project, I had not used version 5 before. Learning the new syntax and components took some time and effort, but I was able to overcome this challenge by reading the documentation and experimenting with the library.

### Package Conflicts

At the beginning of the project, I used create-react-app to set up the development environment. However, I encountered some package conflicts that made it difficult to add new features to the application. To solve this problem, I switched to Vite, which allowed me to use the latest versions of the packages without conflicts.

Despite these challenges, I was able to complete the project on time and deliver a functional application that meets the requirements. I believe that overcoming these challenges has helped me to become a better developer and problem solver.

## Brandbook Compliance

The Fuel Consumption Calculator follows the Intelbras Brandbook by incorporating the brand's color scheme, typography, and design elements into the application. For example, the application uses the Intelbras green (#00a335) as the primary color and the Nunito font for text. Also, a clean and simple design that is consistent with the brand's style.

## Conclusion

The fuel consumption calculator is a useful tool for the freight transport company to calculate the average fuel consumption per ton transported for its fleet of trucks. The application is easy to use and adheres to the Intelbras Brandbook guidelines.
